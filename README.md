HolyRecipes is a front-end-only project built with vanilla JavaScript, HTML, and CSS. This platform is dedicated to celebrating the joy of cooking and sharing delicious recipes during the holiday season. The website aims to provide quick inspiration during a rushed and stressed time allowing for quick filtering based on holiday, dietary or taste needs. Recipes can be browsed or if the user wishes a random recipe can be displayed.
